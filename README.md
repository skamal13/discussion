# Discussion

## Merge Sort
### 1) Is your algorithm correct?

### 2) Time Complexity?
The algorithm works in O(n.logn). This is because the list is being split in log(n) calls and the merging process takes linear time in each call.

### 3) Space Complexity?

### 4) Advanced: Improvements on the algorithm? parallelize using multithreading/multiprocessing

### 5) Advanced: What is the recurrence relation of this particular algorithm?

## Operating Systems and Systems Programming

### 1) B trees (B+ Trees) and their relation to data storage (Postgres)

### 2) A B tree vs hash table # range queries vs specific 1 element queries

### 3) Postgres Indices
